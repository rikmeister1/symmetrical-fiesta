#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One-shot bootstrap for the Vibe Innovation Lab Codespace.
# Runs once on container creation via devcontainer.json postCreateCommand.
# Idempotent: safe to re-run after a manual rebuild.
#
# This script is deliberately soft: a partial failure never marks the
# entire Codespace creation as failed in the VS Code UI, because
# post_start.sh can self-heal on first start. The script always ends
# with `exit 0`.
#
# Output mirroring: every line written to stdout or stderr is also
# written to $REPO/.devcontainer/logs/bootstrap.log via `tee` in a
# process substitution. Logs live in the workspace folder, not in
# /tmp, so they are visible in the VS Code file explorer and survive
# the container's tmpfs quirks. The banner in post_start.sh points
# users at these files and auto-cats them on the first interactive
# shell after each container start.
#
# Output shape: explicit echoes only, no `set -x`. A traced bootstrap
# ran 1000+ lines on `set -x`, which overflowed the VS Code terminal
# scrollback buffer (default 1000 lines) and broke the on-first-shell
# log dump. Keep the output short enough to fit in the scrollback.
#
# Stage order:
#   0. Print environment diagnostics (cwd, PATH, python, pip, npm).
#   1. Install uv (astral.sh). Fall through on failure.
#   2. Install Python dependencies: try `uv sync`, fall back to
#      `pip install -r requirements.txt`, fall back to
#      `pip install streamlit pandas` as a last resort.
#   3. Report whether a streamlit binary is now reachable. No hard exit.
#   4. Pin the Streamlit server config in ~/.streamlit.
#   5. Install the Claude Code CLI via npm. Optional.

# Jump to repo root regardless of caller cwd. Do this before the exec
# redirect so the log path below is resolved relative to the workspace.
