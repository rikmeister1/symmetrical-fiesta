description: Start the Vibe Innovation Framework. Runs entry diagnostic, session planning, ICD initialization, and phase dispatch from the user's current uncertainty level (TRL -2 to 4). Use when the user wants to begin a new innovation project, has only a vague idea or none at all, asks where to start, needs the framework's entry routing, or wants to resume from an existing ICD. Trigger phrases include "start innovation", "ich habe eine Idee", "wo fange ich an", "let us begin", "neues Projekt", "framework run starten", "I want to ideate".

Read the following files:

1. `.claude/docs/orchestrator.md`
2. `.claude/docs/innovation_canvas_document.md`
3. `.claude/docs/trl_specification.md`

Then execute the entry protocol from the Orchestrator:

1. **Language:** Ask for the preferred language first, before any other interaction. Present the question in multiple languages (English, German, French, Spanish) so non-native speakers understand. Switch to the chosen language for all further interaction.
2. **Identity:** Ask for the team or solo name. Use the name naturally throughout the session.
3. **File availability:** Since Claude Code has file system access, verify that the referenced docs exist in `.claude/docs/`. Inform the user if any are missing.
4. **Context loading:** Ask if the user has an existing ICD. If yes, read it. If no, proceed.
5. **Entry diagnostic:** Ask the diagnostic questions (starting point and working name, team composition, prior knowledge, success criteria, biggest uncertainty).
6. **TRL mapping:** Classify uncertainty and map to TRL using the entry phase table in the Orchestrator.
7. **Session plan:** Assemble the phase sequence from the entry TRL through the target exit TRL. Present the plan for confirmation.
8. **ICD initialization:** Generate or load the ICD.
9. **Phase dispatch:** Start the first phase by loading its dedicated file. Each phase closes when its output contract is satisfied.
